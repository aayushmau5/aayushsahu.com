Hi there!

May has been... a month.

- I have been going to office kind of regulary now.
- Worked on a bunch of jira tickets. nice!
- My reading habit took a hit. Not picking up anything yet. Though I have some books I have been wanting to check out.
- Haven't been exploring much new tech either. But I did learn about & implemented ["bloom filter" in elixir](https://gist.github.com/aayushmau5/ed3e4c10540fcf2fb8ce55bec42d410e). Just enough to understand the basics.

**Onto the main thing:**

I shipped the "comments" feature for my blogs!

So for a bit of context, this website's frontend is in NextJS and it connects to a [phoenix](https://github.com/aayushmau5/phoenix.aayushsahu.com) backend through the Phoenix JS client, over channels. So far I use it to track real-time views, and links.

Now It has the ability to store comments! Check the comments section below 👇

This one was fun to work on. It was mostly "vibe coded"(in a hand-held manner == using AI to accelerate the dev process).

I used [tidewave](https://tidewave.ai/) for elixir and phoenix stuff. It works so well!!

The backend involves using ecto to save comments, channels to connect to and send/receive comments. I used Google's [Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/) to stop abuse comments. Also, I have an "admin" dashboard where I can see the comments and delete it in case manual intervention is needed.

On the frontend, It was just a matter of creating necessary UI components and connecting to phoenix channel.

Overall, it was pretty fun to use AI to help me implement stuff!

That's pretty much it! Lets see what June brings ✌️
