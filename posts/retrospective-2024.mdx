yoooooooo! Happy New Year!

It's been a while since my last post. A lot of stuff happened since, so I decided to write some of it down in a "retrospective" post (cause why not?). What have I been upto and what's next?

## Skill Wise

This year I explored quite a lot of stuff.

on the tech side,

I explored racket(beautiful racket) and some scheme. Didn't do anything specific with racket but it's quite beautiful, and i certainly want to do make something with it. Will explore some ideas for sure.

Have been following elixir and it's community for a while now(still my fav lang of all time ngl), and there have been some exiciting stuff happening in the elixir space like set-theoretic types, LiveView Native(for android and iOS apps), membrane(WebRTC stuff), Orb(WASM stuff), etc. This year, I will definitely do some LVN stuff and make some personal utility apps.

Moreover explored music making and music theory, some Digital Signal Processing stuff(mainly audio processing), generative coding with GLSL, read about some DB internals, did some basic Machine Learning in elixir, trying to get Tiling Window Manager working on MacOS, and exploring LLMs(who isn't?).

This year, I want to get more deep into music making, exploring internals of LLMs, more generative art stuff(with touchdesigner/p5.js/threejs), database internals(sqlite), and making more personal projects(WebAudio, WASM, WebCodecs, etc.).

## Life

ah, now comes the complicated part.

This year life had some many ups and downs(i am doing good right now though). Struggled a lot with my mental health, started seeing a therapist, got a lot of insights about myself, became less introverted(more extroverted?). basically a lot of self exploration.

but hey, I have a cat now and my own personal space(I moved away from my home)!!!

didn't do a lot of trips as much as I wanted to(around 3 last year) but this year, I will definitely try to travel more :)

still working at beatoven.ai, and so far things have been fun(with some grunt work here and there ofc).

read some books(the three body problem trilogy has been the highlight), watched a lot of movies(cinephile stuff xP), explored weird corners of music world.

What's Next?

Picking up new hobbies, polishing existing ones, more trips, more self care and getting the feel of life :)

That's been my 2024 so far! Excited to see what's to come next! See ya ðŸ‘‹
