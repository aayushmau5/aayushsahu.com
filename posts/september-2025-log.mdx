Hola! How's it going?

Things have been not so interesting in the month of September.

I picked up a lot of stuff, but mostly ended up leaving them. Such as:

I started reading "The Castle" by Franz Kafka. Pretty kafkaesque. Reminded me so much of the trial which I ended up not completing as well.

I attempted learning "Code to Music" with [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/). This tool is amazing. But the learning curve is steep for someone who has very minimal knowledge about music making.

I wanted to learn Color grading(using Davinci Resolve), and drew some random stuff for a day or two.

All of this lead to nothing. I wasn't feeling inspired. The issue was/is something deeper. I will write it down someday when I feel like it. See, I'm leaving this now. you see the pattern ;)

Overall, pretty eh!

Let's see what the next 3 months bring. Have a good day folks!
