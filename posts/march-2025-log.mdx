Hellooooooo! Here's some of the highlights of this march.

I spent the majority of this month job searching(& prepping up for interviews). AAAAnd big news, I got a new job!!!

I might make a blog post about it ig.

Apart from that, I have been keeping some plants(around 10) in my room. I feel like a parent to them haha, and having been "responsible" for death of 5 plants(wayyy before), I finally started working on taking care of my plants with the help of tech.

I created a "plants" project that reminds me when to give water to my plants, and caring for them. I integrated it in my [Phoenix project](https://phoenix.aayushsahu.com). It will basically email me when I need to give water to my plants.

I integrated Gemini Vision with it so that I can get those tips through AI by uploading the image of the plant.

So there's that. Other things:

- Still reading DDIA albeit a bit slowly
- Started reading "Butter" by Asako Yuzuki
- Going on walking frequently now
- Planning to continue work on [MeowUI](https://aayushsahu.com/blog/meowui) this month
- Onboarding at new workplace

Excited!! Have a great day :)
