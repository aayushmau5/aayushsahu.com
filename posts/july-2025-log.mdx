Hey there, I'm clubbing logs for the last two months, june and july.

Some updates:

- Finished a smol book "Famous no matter the cost" by Blake Crouch. It was ...meh. Having read blake's other books like Dark Matter & Recursion, I was expecting a good thriller, but this one was okay-ish.
- Highly recommend reading "The last question" and "the last answer" by Isaac Asimov. These are short stories but gives you a lot of think about. I feel like these are the things to think about before you drift off to sleep.
- A lot of work at tractable. That reminds me, I need to start logging my work that I do on day-to-day basis. It's pretty easy to forget the things you do. Also, just looking at git log doesn't show the whole picture because some days you are just trying to understand the task or the code. Seems like a good project idea ;)

Some books I have been meaning to pick up: The Iliyad & The Odyssey, I have a book with collection of short stores from Dostoevsky.

On some side-quests:

So instead of trying to find new project ideas to work on, I went back to learning about existing tech. Just to see how they work.

- I went deep into how DNS works. How to work with `dig` and what those `AA`, `AAAA`, `MX` etc. records actually do in your DNS settings. Pretty insightful to see how everything fits together.
- I did Codecrafters' ["build your own redis"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/overview) exercise in [elixir](https://github.com/aayushmau5/codecrafters-redis-elixir). Doesn't cover the whole thing about redis and how DB work but it certainly goes one level down the DB iceberg.
  - the exercises involve parsing and reading redis protocol, how redis replication works(handshake and command propagation), reading redis persistence files(RDB), transactions, streams, etc.

Looking forward to learning a few more things. Some things I want to explore: LSP & how language server works, give Codecrafters' "Make your own shell" a try.

I'm probably forgetting some more things I want to add here, but eh, this feels good enough.

Have an awesome day, see ya!
