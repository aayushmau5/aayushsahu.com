Last year while exploring programming languages I stumbled upon scheme. Emacs uses their own flavour of scheme.

I dig the idea of a standard while many languages implement while providing their own set of functionalities.

Guix uses scheme. Guile is the language. I learned that guix is an alternative to nix(i have used nix but not as my primary os package manager).

While learning guile, I easily liked the scheme syntax, the brackets, how it maps to an AST in a way.

But while I wanted to make a smol project using Guile, I found it hard to find packages in the ecosystems and what the community prefers.

So i set out to find more languages that are scheme-like.

I stumbled upon racket. Racket seemed pretty solid in terms of having weird and fun projects online, the community and the documentation. 

That was just the tip of iceberg though.

As i started going through the dense forest of racket, i found things which put the language in a special place in my heart.

I started doing racket through beautiful racket which goes through making your own language using racket.

I tell you while using dr racket and getting to introspect the language while writing it, racket's # syntax instruction.
I found the language very fun and very informative. 

I felt that we as programmers are missing out a lot on current leading languages landscape. While they get the job done, I feel like these languages and the toolings they provide is needed in leading languages. 

Why? Because its just fun. Writing softwares should be fun. We can build good products sure, but who said it can't be more fun :)
