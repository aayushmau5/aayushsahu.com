# Introduction

**MDX** is a markdown extension that brings in support for JS components(typically react components, but not only limited to react) inside markdown.

This blog post shows what I did to use MDX with NextJS, some roadblocks I ran into, & my learnings. Let's get started!

To know more about MDX, checkout the official docs [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/).

# Goal

With MDX, we can:

- use existing react components in our MDX
- import other MDX files as components, though I wasn't able to implement this with the approach I took

But my main goal was to:

- Get MDX working
- Integrate remark/rehype plugins for syntax highlighting, headings, etc.
- Using custom react components inside my blogs

# Installing MDX

To use MDX, you need to use the MDX compiler which compiles MDX documents to JavaScript.

> MDX is a language that's compiled to JS. MDX also compiles regular markdown to JS.

If you are using a bundler, you need to integrate MDX in your bundler.

Ex.
- For **esbuild**, use `@mdx-js/esbuild` integration
- For **Rollup**, use `@mdx-js/rollup` integration
- For **webpack**, use `@mdx-js/loader` integration(CRA, NextJS, Vue CLI)

You can also use MDX if you are not using a bundler:

- If you want to import MDX files in NodeJS, use `@mdx-js/node-loader`
- Otherwise, install and use the core compiler `@mdx-js/mdx` to manually compile MDX files.

For more detailed info, checkout the [official docs](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/).

Now that you have integration setup with your bundler, its time to setup the JSX runtime.

If you are using React, you don't need to do anything. Perhaps install `@mdx-js/react` for some configurations.

# Using with NextJS

So, there are multiple options in order to use MDX with NextJS.

- `@next/mdx`
- `next-mdx-enhanced`
- `next-mdx-remote`
- `mdx-bundler`

[This article](https://dev.to/tylerlwsmith/quick-comparison-of-mdx-integration-strategies-with-next-js-1kcm) goes over the comparison.

There's no "the best" solution out there. Just use the one you feel like going with, and if you face any problems during the way, try to fix or switch.

Next supports webpack loaders by overwriting the webpack config in `next.config.js`

Install and configure the webpack loader `@mdx-js/loader`. There is no need to configure your JSX runtime as React is already set up.

With the new NextJS SWC compiler, it should work out of the box.
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/30436

It seems that it works OOTB with the new compiler

I just added these lines in `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  pageExtensions: ["md", "mdx", "tsx", "ts", "jsx", "js"],
  webpack(config, options) {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mdx?$/,
      use: [
        options.defaultLoaders.babel,
        {
          loader: "@mdx-js/loader",
        },
      ],
    });

    return config;
  },
};
```

and made a `something.mdx` file in `/pages` and damn, it hot refreshes.

Pretty neat stuff.

But some YT videos use `mdx-enhanced` or `next-mdx` ??
Need to check and see the differences.
`next-mdx-remote`, `mdx-bundler`

- https://dev.to/tylerlwsmith/quick-comparison-of-mdx-integration-strategies-with-next-js-1kcm
- https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/ (Seriously, read this blog)

So it turns out they are used for the same thing but with different features.

- https://dev.to/tylerlwsmith/quick-comparison-of-mdx-integration-strategies-with-next-js-1kcm
  This article covers it well.

`MDXProvider` from `@mdx-js/react` for ig provide more control over how the markdown is rendered.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import Content from "../demo/hello.md";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <MDXProvider components={components}>
      <Content />
    </MDXProvider>
  );
}

const components = {
  h1: ({ children }) => (
    <h1 style={{ border: "12px solid red" }}>{children}</h1>
  ),
};
```

The compiled output is just an array of objects with some "special" properties that we can work on and make some powerful stuff.

MDX is really really cool. https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-mdx-v2-syntax

## Choosing the right package or loader for using MDX with NextJS

I'm using `@next-mdx`. But I'll explore `mdx-bundler` in the future.

```js
// next.config.js
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")();
module.exports = withMDX();

// or

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
});

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
});
```

Now what?

Things I first need to do:

Since all my markdown files are in `/posts`, I need to import them and make them use a slug.
But do we really want that?

`getStaticProps` only fetches at build time. So, no HMR i guess.

The official MDX docs: https://mdxjs.com/docs/

Installing `@mdx-js/react` to get more control?

Now what to do?

I have moved all my posts files into `/blog/posts/`, but how to get the SEO benefits and stuff?

See nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx

> Tried adding remark/rehype plugins in nextmdx but they fail because they are ESM only, and I'm just require-ing them inside next.config.js file.

Don't know where to go from here?

```js
const rehypeSlug = require("rehype-slug");
const remarkToc = require("remark-toc");
const headingId = require("remark-heading-id");

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkToc, headingId],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug],
  },
});

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["md", "tsx"],
});
```

^^ will fail.

Now i'm trying mdx-bundler.
Though it says it is best suited for runtime bundling, I want to bundle it during build time. The readme says it can be used as a build time bundler also. lets see how.

Now trying Next-mdx-remote

`next-mdx-remote` was the first that worked for me. and I couldn't be happier.
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote

Though I'm not quite sure how to pass options to remark plugins.

Looking at importing components, I'm concerned about bundling.

We are importing all the components during build time, and that might increase the bundlie size.

Though we can use dynamic import, but we don't want to fetch everything until it is used. (Does this problem only persist in next-mdx-remote or is it true for every mdx file.)

Looking at network tabs, it seems the content are being loaded dynamically **on demand**.

Future: First of all, look at compilation and bundling.

Importing a single component in multiple project duplicates the data?

---

Reading about `next-mdx-remote`, it turns out that all the components are bundled during build time and It is available to every MDX file.
Though one can use dynamic importing and some clever hack to dynamically import heavy components.
See more at: https://github.com/hasicorp/next-mdx-enhanced/issues/103

But what about next-mdx? Does it import components per md file(which is what I want ideally) or it imports everything?

Another thing I want is the ability to see realtime changes(HMR) in md files instead of refreshing the page again and again.
Though for this, I think I have to move all my md files inside the `pages/` directory.

Nice codeblocks: https://ped.ro/blog/code-blocks-but-better

---

So I found a way to use rehype plugins inside `next.config.js`,
just rename the file to `next.config.mjs` to use ESM modules instead of CJS ones.

and then

```js
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import remarkToc from "remark-toc";
import NextMdx from "@next/mdx";

const withMDX = NextMdx({
  extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkToc],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug],
  },
});

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["md", "tsx"],
});
```

That's all. It's working now. Oops, not working.

But the internet said to upgrade nextjs, which I have the latest version of. So, It looks like my journey with Next/MDX is over :(

---

One thing I wanted to know about Next/MDX was whether the components we imported in our MDX pages only increased bundle size of that component itself or did it increased the bundle size overall?

Well I checked, and it turns out the components only increase the bundle size of MDX page itself, and not overall page.

But now I need to see how to use this in childrens.

import Test from "components/Test.tsx";

<h1>Hello world</h1>

export default (props) => {
  console.log(props);
  return <div style={{ border: "2px solid red" }}>{props.children}</div>;
};
```

---

```
import Test from "components/Test.tsx";

## Hello, world

- first
- second

<Test message="LOL" />

export const name = "your name";

export default (props) => {
  console.log(props);
  return (
    <div style={{ border: "2px solid red" }}>
      <p style={{ border: "2px solid green" }}>{props.name}</p>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

^^ This works flawlessly.

## NextMDX vs next-mdx-remote in terms of bundle size

Both do the same thing.

Another question: What does `getStaticProps` do in NextJS in terms of bundle size?

Use this to get realtime HMR thing: https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch

https://github.com/nicolastoulemont/blog

After much thought, I went with `next-mdx-remote`.
Mainly because it did not needed to interfere with next configs.

My only concern now is that the bundle size and loading all the data in slug.

---

All steps to using Next MDX Remote:

Install the package

```
npm i next-mdx-remote
```

Inside your [slug]

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths } from "next";
import { BsArrowLeftShort } from "react-icons/bs";
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";
import rehypePrism from "rehype-prism-plus";
import remarkToc from "remark-toc";
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings";
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from "@/utils/getPosts";
import BlogContainer from "@/components/BlogContainer";
import { BlogSEO } from "@/components/SEO";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

// const Test = dynamic(() => import("MdxComponents/Test"));
import Test from "MdxComponents/Test";
const DirectoryStructure = dynamic(
  () => import("MdxComponents/DirectoryStructure")
);

function BackToHomePage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return <button onClick={() => router.push("/")}>Back to home page</button>;
}

const components = {
  Test,
  DirectoryStructure,
  BackToHomePage,
};

export default function BlogPost({ source, frontmatter, slug }) {
  return (
    <>
      <BlogSEO
        title={frontmatter.title}
        summary={frontmatter.description}
        date={frontmatter.date}
        image={frontmatter.cover?.image}
        slug={slug}
      />
      <Link href="/blog">
        <a className="styledLink">
          <BsArrowLeftShort />
          Back
        </a>
      </Link>
      <BlogContainer frontmatter={frontmatter}>
        <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
      </BlogContainer>
    </>
  );
}

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  const paths = getAllPostIds();
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const { content, frontmatter, slug } = await getPostData(
    params.slug as string
  );
  const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
    scope: frontmatter,
    mdxOptions: {
      rehypePlugins: [
        [rehypeAutolinkHeadings, { behavior: "append" }],
        [rehypePrism, { showLineNumbers: true }],
        rehypeSlug,
      ],
      remarkPlugins: [[remarkToc, { tight: true }]],
    },
  });
  return { props: { source: mdxSource, frontmatter, slug } };
};
```

Inside `getPostData.ts`

```ts
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import { remark } from "remark";
import readingTime from "reading-time";
import html from "remark-html";

const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "posts");
const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);

export function getSortedPostsData() {
  const allPostsData: any = fileNames
    .map((fileName) => {
      const slug = fileName.replace(/\.md$/, "");
      const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
      const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf-8");

      const { data: frontMatter, content } = matter(fileContents);
      frontMatter.date = new Date(frontMatter.date).toISOString();
      frontMatter.readingTime = readingTime(content);
      return {
        slug,
        ...frontMatter,
      };
    })
    .filter((val: any) => !val.draft);

  return allPostsData.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.date < b.date) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  });
}

export function getAllTags() {
  // TODO: need to get the blog data associated with a certain tag
  const allTags: string[] = [];

  const data = fileNames
    .map((fileName) => {
      const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
      const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf-8");

      const { data: frontMatter } = matter(fileContents);
      return frontMatter;
    })
    .filter((frontMatter) => {
      return !frontMatter.draft;
    });

  data.forEach((frontMatter) => {
    const tags: string | string[] = frontMatter.tags;
    if (tags) {
      if (Array.isArray(tags)) {
        const newTags = tags.filter((tag) => !allTags.includes(tag));
        allTags.push(...newTags);
        return allTags;
      }
      if (allTags.includes(tags)) {
        return allTags;
      }
      allTags.push(tags);
    }
  });

  return allTags;
}

export function getAllPostIds() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  return fileNames.map((fileName) => ({
    params: {
      slug: fileName.replace(/\.md$/, ""),
    },
  }));
}

export async function getPostData(slug: string) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf-8");

  const matterResult = matter(fileContents);
  matterResult.data.date = new Date(matterResult.data.date).toISOString();
  matterResult.data.readingTime = readingTime(matterResult.content);
  if (matterResult.data.cover?.caption) {
    const caption = await remark()
      .use(html, { sanitize: false })
      .process(matterResult.data.cover.caption);
    matterResult.data.cover.caption = caption.toString();
  }

  return {
    slug,
    content: matterResult.content,
    frontmatter: matterResult.data,
  };
}
```

For some other concerns, I will see them next.

https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode
Preview mode doesn't work due to 2kb limit and much more work to setup.
