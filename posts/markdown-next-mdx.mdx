MDX: Markdown with component
// Short intro for MDX

Need integrations for framework, bundlers, etc.

- Using existing components in your MDX
- Importing other MDX files as components(pretty interesting, perhaps I can have frontmatter in another MDX file)

Everything you ever need? https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/

## Integrating MDX into your project

Using MDX with your bundler and JSX runtime.

JSX runtime like React, preact, vue, etc.
MDX does compile JSX to javascript for us.

`@mdx-js/*` packages. All of them as ESM only, so only `import` statements.


## Quick start

### Bundler

MDX is a language that's compiled to JS. MDX also compiles regular markdown to JS.

But we need to use an integration for our bundler(if we have one).

Ex. 
- For **esbuild**, use `@mdx-js/esbuild` integration
- For **Rollup**, use `@mdx-js/rollup` integration
- For **webpack**, use `@mdx-js/loader` integration(CRA, NextJS, Vue CLI)

Though now that NextJS uses `swc`, need to check how to integrate it with SWC.

We can also use MDX if we are not using a bundler:
- If we want to import MDX files in NodeJS, use `@mdx-js/node-loader`
- Otherwise, install and use the core compiler `@mdx-js/mdx` to manually compiler MDX files.

There are dedicated pages for using MDX with popular tools like CRA, esbuild, Next etc.

We need to look into the NextJS one.

### JSX

Now that we have integration setup with our bundler, its time to setup the JSX runtime.

If we are using React, we don't need to do anything. Perhaps install `@mdx-js/react` to configure some stuff(not sure what stuff though, need to look).

### Editor

VSCode extension to support MDX: `silvenon/vscode-mdx` or `xyc/vscode-mdx-preview`

### Types or usage with TS

Need to install `@types/mdx`

## Using with NextJS

Next supports webpack loaders by overwriting the webpack config in `next.config.js`

Install and configure the webpack loader `@mdx-js/loader`. There is no need to configure your JSX runtime as React is already set up.


With the new NextJS SWC compiler, it should work out of the box.
