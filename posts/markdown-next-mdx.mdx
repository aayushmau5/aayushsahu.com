# Introduction

**MDX** is a markdown extension that brings in support for JS components(typically react components, but not only limited to) inside markdown.

To know more about MDX, checkout the official MDX docs [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/).

Here's what I did inorder to use MDX with NextJS.

# Goal

My main goal was to:

- Get MDX working.
- Integrate remark/rehype plugins for syntax highlighting, heading links, generating slugs, etc.
- Using custom react components inside my blogs.
- Sourcing contents from different directory. All my blogs are in a `posts/` directory, so I want this directory to be the source.

# Using MDX with NextJS

The idea of using MDX in my blogs came from [this article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/) by [Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). I wanted more control over how certain elements of my blogs will be show, as well as using custom react components inside my blogs.

As it turns out, there are multiple libraries that allows us to use MDX with NextJS. Some of them are(based on popularity/usage):

- `@next/mdx`
- `mdx-bundler`
- `next-mdx-enhanced` (**deprecated**, maintainers now recommend `next-mdx-remote`)
- `next-mdx-remote`

[This article](https://dev.to/tylerlwsmith/quick-comparison-of-mdx-integration-strategies-with-next-js-1kcm) compares these libraries pretty well.

I was pretty confused as to which library should I go with. After having some problems with `@next/mdx`, I went ahead with `next-mdx-remote`, which turned out to be a pretty good choice.

<HiddenExpand summary="The problems I faced with @next/mdx">

At first, I was not sure which library to go with. So, I started with `@next/mdx`, but some things went wrong ðŸ‘‡

**Trying `@next/mdx`**

I followed [this official guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) to setup MDX. In order to use MDX with NextJS, I have to modify the NextJS config file `next.config.js`.

First, install the library

```
npm i @next/mdx
```

Then modify `next.config.js` as below.

<CustomCode filename="next.config.js">
```js
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")();
module.exports = withMDX();

// OR

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
});

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
});
```
</CustomCode>

After making these changes, I went ahead and made a `.mdx` file inside the `/pages` directory. And it worked!

**The problem**

As I said in one of my goals, I use `remark`/`rehype` plugins in order to have syntax highlighting, heading links, generating slugs, etc. And these remark plugins are ESM only(i.e. they use `import` instead of `require`), and I couldn't use `import` statements inside `next.config.js`.

However, I did manage to workaround this problem by having `"type": "module"` in `package.json` and rename `next.config.js` to `next.config.mjs`.

Now my `next.config.mjs` looks like this:

```js
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import remarkToc from "remark-toc";
import NextMdx from "@next/mdx";

const withMDX = NextMdx({
  extension: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkToc],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug],
  },
});

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
});
```

Though this didn't help because I started getting webpack warnings with these plugins, and some plugins refused to work. The internet didn't help ðŸ˜ž

And with that, my journey with `@next/mdx` ended.

# Using `next-mdx-remote`

Let's get started with integrating `next-mdx-remote`.

## Directory Structure

Here's how my directories look like:

```
posts/
â”œâ”€â”€ blog1.mdx
â””â”€â”€ blog2.mdx
pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [slug].js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
utils/
â””â”€â”€ getPostData.js
```

As I said earlier, the `posts/` directory contains all my `mdx` blogs, and `utils/getPostData.js` contains some utility functions. We will see what those utility functions are, later.

`pages/blog/index.js` points to `/blog` route & `pages/blog/[slug].js` is a dynamic route which will point to anything that comes after `/blog`, for example, `/blog/something`. This is how NextJS routing works. The point being, `/blog` route will have the index of all blogs, and the dynamic route will point to a specific blog(identified by the `slug`) which will be the MDX blog.

## Steps

Install the following packages

```
npm i next-mdx-remote gray-matter
```

One thing to note about `next-mdx-remote` is that it doesn't care about where your data comes from, all it needs is that you provide the data. Like I said earlier, all my MDX blogs are inside a `posts/` directory, so I need to perform some kind of operation in order to provide `next-mdx-remote` my MDX blogs data from `posts/` directory.

We will create some utility functions that will:

- get all the **sorted** posts data(like the contents, and frontmatter). This will be used in `/blog` route to index all the blogs.
- get all the post id(aka `slug`).
- get post contents corresponding to their `slug`.

We will read all the mdx files from `posts/` directory, and parse their frontmatter using the [gray-matter library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter).

Here's the code:

<CustomCode filename="utils/getPostData.js">
```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "posts"); // the posts/ directory path
const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory); // all the mdx files inside the posts/ directory

// sorted post data
export function getSortedPostsData() {
  const allPostsData = fileNames.map((fileName) => {
    const slug = fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, ""); // remove the .mdx extension from file names

    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf-8"); // read the file contents

    const { data: frontMatter } = matter(fileContents); // get the frontmatter

    return {
      slug,
      ...frontMatter,
    };
  });

  // sort the posts
  return allPostsData.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.date < b.date) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  });
}

// all post ids(or slug)
export function getAllPostIds() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  return fileNames.map((fileName) => ({
    params: {
      slug: fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, ""),
    },
  }));
}

// a particular post data
export async function getPostData(slug) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.mdx`); // get the full path of a post
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf-8"); // read the post contents

  const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

  return {
    slug,
    content: matterResult.content, // the file contents without the frontmatter
    frontmatter: matterResult.data, // the frontmatter
  };
}
```
</CustomCode>

After this, first we will index all the blogs inside `/blogs` route. Put the following code in `pages/blog/index.js` file.

<CustomCode filename="/pages/blog/index.js">
```jsx
import { getSortedPostsData } from "utils/getPostData";

export default function Blogs({ posts }) {
  // maps through the blog posts and renders them as a list
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post, index) => (
        <Link key={index} href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>
          <a>{post.title}</a>
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticProps = () => {
  const posts = getSortedPostsData(); // get all the sorted posts data

  return {
    props: {
      // pass it to the component through props
      posts,
    },
  };
};
```
</CustomCode>

We are using the `getSortedPostsData` utility function to get all the sorted posts, and then rendering it on the page. That's it.

One cool thing about this is, we are statically generating the data using `getStaticProps`, meaning all the pages will be generated at built time. More info about `getStaticProps` [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props).

Now that we have an index page, users can click on any of the link, and they will be directed to `/blog/<blog-slug>` route, which will be handled by our `/pages/blog/[slug].js` code.

Here's the code for that:

<CustomCode filename="/pages/blog/[slug].js">
```jsx
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";

import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from "utils/getPosts";

export default function BlogPost({ source }) {
  // render the blog
  return (
    <div>
      <MDXRemote {...source} />
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const paths = getAllPostIds(); // all the posts slug
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const { content } = await getPostData(params.slug); // the post data in string
  const mdxSource = await serialize(content); // parse the MDX string
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } };
};
```
</CustomCode>

Let's start with [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths) first. Using `getStaticPaths` we define a list of paths that we want to be statically generated. We are passing all the blog slugs so that our blogs can be statically generated.

Now, onto `getStaticProps`, the blog we want to access will be passed to the `slug` property in `params` object. Using that slug, we get the post data using `getPostData` utility function. This post data is just our MDX blog as a string.

We then pass the MDX string to `serialize` function which we are importing from `next-mdx-remote/serialize`. This function parses and compiles the provided MDX string and, returns a result which can be passed into a component to be rendered. The compiled MDX is then passed to our `BlogPost` component through the `props`(The return value from `getStaticProps` is passed to the rendering component).

Inside our `BlogPost` component, we are using the `MDXRemote` component imported from `next-mdx-remote` whose job is to render the compiled blog that we are getting from the props.

That's it. Start the nextjs dev server, and go to `/blog`, we will see the list of blogs. And on going to certain blog, we will see the rendered MDX blog.

## Using remark/rehype plugins

Now that we have setup MDX, it's time to use Remark/Rehype plugins. These plugins is used to provide syntax highlighting, have autolinks in headings, generate table of contents, etc.

We will use `rehype-prism-plus` to provide syntax highlighting, and `remark-toc` to generate Table of Contents.

```
npm i rehype-prism-plus remark-toc
```

Since remark/rehype plugins only support ESM, we can use it inside our `/pages/blog/[slug].js` file(instead of using it inside `next.config.js`).

Here's the code:

<CustomCode filename="/pages/blog/[slug].js">
```jsx
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";

import rehypePrism from "rehype-prism-plus";
import remarkToc from "remark-toc";

import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from "utils/getPosts";

export default function BlogPost({ source }) {
  // render the MDX blog
  return (
    <div>
      <MDXRemote {...source} />
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const paths = getAllPostIds(); // all the posts slug
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const { content } = await getPostData(params.slug); // the post data in string
  const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      rehypePlugins: [
        // passing rehype plugins(in an array)
        [rehypePrism, { showLineNumbers: true }], // to pass options to plugins, put the plugin in an array, and 2nd element should be the options object
      ],
      remarkPlugins: [remarkToc], // passing remark plugins
    },
  }); // parse the MDX string, now with pulgins
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } };
};
```
</CustomCode>

Everything remains the same except the part where we are parsing and compiling the MDX string. The `serialize` function takes a second parameter, which is a config object. In this config object, we are providing `mdxOptions` which is another object in which we pass remark and rehype plugins separately. One thing to know that is these plugins are used during the compilation of our MDX blog. That's why they are passed as options to the `serialize` function.

And with that, we should have our plugin working.

## Using custom react components

One of MDX's prominent feature is it allows us to use React components inside our blogs, and it would be a shame if we didn't use this feature. So, let's use a React component inside our blog(for the sake of the length of _this_ blog, the component will be a simple one). Here it is:

<CustomCode filename="utils/ShowContentInside.js">
```jsx
export default function ShowContentInside({ heading, children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{heading}</h1>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</CustomCode>

This component takes a `heading` prop, and a children to show the contents inside it.

Here's an example blog using the component(make sure to look at the [syntax](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/) to see how to use components inside MDX).

```md
---
title: "Using MDX with NextJS"
description: "How to use MDX with NextJS?"
---

Hello, world!

<ShowContentInside heading="this is a heading">

Show the contents inside it.

A valid markdown.

- This
- is a bullet point

</ShowContentInside>
```

This however won't work. How would our MDX document know where to get the `ShowContentInside` component?

For this, we need to pass our MDX renderer the `ShowContentInside` component(this behavior may differ in other MDX libraries in that you could import components inside your MDX document itself, but `next-mdx-remote` doesn't work like this).

<CustomCode filename="/pages/blog/[slug].js">
```js
// ...omitted

import ShowContentInside from "utils/ShowContentInside";

const component = {
  // react components to be passed to MDX renderer
  ShowContentInside,
};

export default function BlogPost({ source }) {
  // render the MDX blog(now with react components)
  return (
    <div>
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  );
}

// ...omitted
```
</CustomCode>

First we import our component, and then pass it to `MDXRemote` renderer component through `components` prop as an object. Now, during the rendering of our MDX blog, these components will be used inside our blogs.

Aaand we are done! ðŸ¥³

With that, we have seen:

- how to use MDX using `next-mdx-remote`
- how to use remark/rehype plugins with MDX
- how to use react components with MDX

We have now a working blog page using MDX.

## Concerns

These are some of the concerns I had when using `next-mdx-remote`.

### Bundle size

When reading up about `next-mdx-remote`, I got to know that all the components are bundled during build time and it is available to every MDX file. Meaning even if some of our blog won't be using a certain component, it will still be available to them. Thus, users have to download those unnecessary components as well.

To overcome this issue, one can use dynamic importing. I found [this thread](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced/issues/103) which goes over this. Also, [the example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote) addresses this issue.

For me, I didn't find any drastic increase in bundle size, so I just did nothing ðŸ¤·.

### Auto refresh on changes

One thing I missed while using `next-mdx-remote` is Hot Module Reload(HMR) which basically auto-refreshes your website whenever you make changes to files(in development mode).

However, I did find [`next-remote-watch`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch) which wasn't exactly equivalent to HMR, but it gets the job done. I just had to pass the directory(in this case my `posts/` directory) which I wanted to watch.

I did check NextJS' [preview mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode), but it didn't work because of a 2kb data limit, and required more involved work to setup.

# A word about `mdx-bundler`

I have seen some people recommend `mdx-bundler`. It seemed to have all the goodies to use MDX. And it is framework agnostic, so one can use it with other frameworks.

But right now, `next-mdx-remote` does the job for me, so I haven't dwelled much into `mdx-bundler`. But if anything comes up, I would love to give it a try.

> There's no "the best" solution out there. Just use the one you feel like going with, and if you face any problems in the way, try to fix it or switch to other solution.
