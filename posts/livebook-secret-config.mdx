In elixir, when you are working with libraries that require setting some configurations such as access keys, the traditional way is to put configs inside the `config/` directory.

For example, using [`ex_aws` library](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws), we need to set `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` in the config.

So, inside our `config/dev.exs`(or `config/prod.exs`), we put the following code:

```elixir filename=config/dev.exs
import Config

config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, :instance_role]
```

and it works as intended. The problem arises when you want to use this library(or similar ones that require setting config) inside livebook. You can't really use the above code to set the configurations.

Well, it turns out livebook(or rather `Mix`) has a different way to set these configs.

Let's see an example:

Imagine a library named `very_cool_library` that requires `cool_name` to be set through config. Lets use `Mix.install` to install this library.

```elixir filename=example.livemd
Mix.install([:very_cool_library])
```

Now, we need to set `cool_name` through config. To do that, `Mix.install` takes an optional keyword list argument named `config`(how convenient). The value of `config` should be a keyword list, and the keyword list must contain the library's name for which we want to add config.

```elixir filename=example.livemd
Mix.install([:very_cool_library], config: [
	very_cool_library: []
])
```

The value of this library name key is another keyword list. We can put in the key and value of the config that the library requires. Here's the full code:

```elixir filename=example.livemd
Mix.install([:very_cool_library], config: [
	very_cool_library: [
		cool_name: "Mario"
	]
])
```

And that's it! Everything should work as flawlessley.

Taking our previous example of `ex_aws` library which requires `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` to be set through config, here's the equivalent for livebook:

```elixir filename=example.livemd
Mix.install([:ex_aws], config: [
	ex_aws: [
      access_key_id: [{:system, "<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"}, :instance_role], # or key as a string
      secret_access_key: [{:system, "<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"}, :instance_role] # or key as a string
	]
])
```

## Setting config with new livebook secrets feature

With release of [livebook 0.7](https://news.livebook.dev/whats-new-in-livebook-0.7-2wOPsY), you can using secrets within your livebook without exposing it to others(which one would've easily done with the above approach).

Set the livebook secret with keys "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY".

Now, just use this key with prefix "LB\_" inside the config(livebook fills in the secrets that start with "LB" automatically):

```elixir filename=example.livemd
Mix.install([:ex_aws], config: [
	ex_aws: [
      access_key_id: [{:system, "LB_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, :instance_role],
      secret_access_key: [{:system, "LB_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, :instance_role]
	]
])
```

and everything should work as expected! No more accidental secret sharing with others.
