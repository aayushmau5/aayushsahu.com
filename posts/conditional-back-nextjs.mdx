Suppose you have a page that only has a button "Go to settings". Now, the settings page has a "Go back" button, which goes back to the previous URL(duh!).

Now, you have got a "loop", where on clicking the "Go back" button, it sends you to the previous page which only has a "Go to settings" button. Then, going back to the settings page, having "Go back" button. Round and round we go!

You have to manually modify the URL in-order to go to some other URL.

But with NextJS, you can conditionally change where the back button leads to. Let's take a look!

# Current code

The code for settings page lives in `pages/settings.js` file. Here's how your current code might look like. We are using NextJS' router for routing purpose.

```jsx filename=settings.js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function SettingsPage() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => router.back()}>Go back</button>
      Some other stuff
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Fix

Suppose the previous page, which only has a "Go back to settings" has the URL `/something`. When you go to settings page from this page, you can use NextJS' `getServerSideProps` `context` data to get the previous url from which the current page came to be.

Precisely, `context.req.headers.referer` contains this data. For example, going from `/something` to `/settings` page, will give you the full URL of `/something` page inside `getServerSideProps`.

Thus, we pass the `context.req.headers.referer` value to our page component through `props`. If you are not sure how can we pass this props, checkout the docs for `getServerSideProps` [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).

Now, we just have to get the previous URL inside our page component, and conditionally change where the `router` function will take us.

```jsx filename=settings.js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const previousUrl = context.req.headers.referer;
  return {
    props: { previousUrl },
  };
}

export default function SettingsPage(props) {
  const router = useRouter();

  // Check if previous URL is /something. If it is, send user to home page, otherwise go back as normal
  function goToPreviousPage() {
    if (props.previousUrl.includes("/something")) {
      router.push("/");
    } else {
      router.back();
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={goToPreviousPage}>Go back</button>
      Some other stuff
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it!
