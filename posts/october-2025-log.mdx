Bonjour! I hope you are having an amazing day :)

I'm writing this log down in the month of November, and I forgot most of the things I did last month xD

It was Diwali so I went home as well. It was quite nice to take a short break from the world.

From the things I remember:

- I finally finished reading a book, yay! I read "A Thousand Splendid Suns" by Khaled Hosseni. It was a grim, and depressing story. But certainly a necessary one to read in this day & age.
  - I love books that give me a new perspective on things ykwim? For example, "The vegetarian" put me in the shoes of a women living in South Korea society, and how it affects them.
  - Similarly, a Thousand Splendid Suns gave me a new perspective on war, the role women were expected to play, love & death.
- I have purchased some more books to read. Keep an eye on new logs :P

- On the tech side, I have been looking around to learn a new programming language. I like programming languages, what each of them bring to the table, how one language does some things better than the others, etc. It all about perspective i guess.
  - After stumbling around for a while, I started looking into erlang. I know elixir, and I know it's based on top of erlang, so let's give erlang a shot.
  - I'm still going through some of the stuff around the language, so initially, I dig it. It's concise, it looks elegant so far. Only time will tell how I end up liking it.
  
  
  
```erlang
-module(say_hi).

-export([greet/1]).

greet(Name) ->
	io:fwrite("Hello ~s!~n", [Name]).
```

Special log:

I binge watched the entirety of **Twin Peaks** in October. It was peak!

I have seem some of David Lynch stuff before watching twin peaks, like Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway & Blue Velvet, but Twin Peaks is the blueprint.

It's kinda long, so I recommend watching it in 1.5x, but damn man, was it worth it!

I think that's pretty much it. My days consist of working, reading books, watching movies(should I log them as well?), going out, playing with my cat & playing games.

See you on the other one!
