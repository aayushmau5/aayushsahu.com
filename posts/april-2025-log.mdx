hello hello

a bit late, but here it goes:

- Main highlight: I switched jobs this month. Now i'm working at [tractable](https://tractable.ai/) as a Software Engineer.
- Read two books: "Genetic Algorithms in Elixir" and "Metaprogramming Elixir". Wrote a companion [blog](/blog/genetic-elixir) about genetic programming.
- Last month, I started reading "Butter" but yeah, didn't pick it up again(life happened).

that's pretty much it. not much, but hopefully I'll have more stuff to write about next month :)

see ya!
