- tech debt
  - refactor or it will end up taking up most of your time.
- agreeing on a structure at first
- style guide
- documentation
- Thinking from the ground up
- low confidence(like having your own lease)
- views on AWS
- Cost of refactoring
- on the shoulders of giants
- effective communication
- scaling
  - caching
  - avoid refetching as much as you can
- choosing an API framework(nestjs)
  - Express too low level or need better error handling
- API is not something you just make a backend on and slap a documentation.
