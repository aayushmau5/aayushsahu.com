Merry Christmas! 🎄

I am writing on my github mobile app at 2:36am on Christmas day. Feeling pretty happy because we hosted a potluck christmas eve part at our flat. It was so much fun hanging out and cooking/eating together with your friends ♥️

Writing this pretty late this month. Been busy with life and my cat.

Alright, things I did:

I went on a trip to Sikkim this month. A week's trip.
I travelled with my family. We went to gangtok, zero point, north sikkim, south sikkim and darjeeling. It was so much fun.

Decided to go No Social Media for the whole trip. Honestly, it felt really peaceful to not be on your phone and know about the horros of the world :)

Felt more present and at calm. Then the trip ended and the cycle of corporate life went on :P

I purchased two books in Gangtok: The Vegeterian by Han Kang & Before the coffee gets cold.
I read "Before the coffee gets cold" during the trip. Such a heartfelt story about grief, regret, and the human wish to change things in the past, while forgetting about the influence they have in the present.

I have quite some books in my immediate reading list: Blue Sisters, The Vegetarian, I Want to Die but I want to Eat Tteokpokki by Baek Se-hee, and the rest of books in the "Before the coffee gets cold" series.

Continued on learning about erlang. Been eyeing to do some terminal UI stuff with new erlang raw terminal mode support.

Also, went to Dehradun for my friend's sister's wedding. Such a nice place, and frens.

Apart from that, November has been pretty chill. December chiller(quite literally).

See you on the next one!
