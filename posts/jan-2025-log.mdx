Here's a log of things I did in January 2025.

Tech:
- Learned rust using The Rust book
- Started working on a text editor using rust(got a high overview of terminal based text editor) - [hecto](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/)
- Gave LVN a try. It's still in it's early days. Gave some feedback to the LVN team. Will explore more later.

Next on rust:
- I'm working on a TUI project for personal use
- Making on OS in rust(https://os.phil-opp.com/)
- WASM in Rust
- Rustler(powering elixir with rust)

Life:

- Read the bell jar
- Trying to get into a routine

bye bye!
