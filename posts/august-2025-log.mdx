Ahoy there!

This month was kinda interesting.

Starting with:

- I read `The Vegetarian` by Han Kang. It's a pretty bleak book but insighful about korean socities and role of women there. Having seen some Korean series, it's not hard to see the similarities. Anyway, a recommended read!
- Apart from this, I did pick up some other books, but I ended up leaving all of them at one point or another. Simply because of lack of interest. I'm pretty sure I'll go back to them. In its own time :)
  - Notes from underground by dostovesky
  - build your own lisp(in C)
  - Microservices patterns

Tech:

- I suddenly got intersted in how regex systems work. I looked up some stuff blogs on making a regex engine. Deep rabbit hole I tell you. A lot of automata, language theory, regular languages, etc.
  - Note on LLM usage: I used cursor + claude to generate a bunch of exercies that builds up to creating your own regex engine from scratch. Basically a TDD powered by LLMs.
  - Still learning. Slowly but surely.
- I created a font from my handwriting using [Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/). I have added it in this website. You'll see it heading of pages.
  - Making a font from your handwriting has never been this easy with the help of Calligraphr. Note that it's a paid service but their ethics made me use it. And the result ends up being great.
- I added a [Contact](/contact) page for people to reach out to me directly. It's powered by phoenix. Connected through channel. And I have created a dashboard to see the messages people have sent me.
  - Why? I don't know but I do like conversating with people about tech, life, art, books. Even though I don't advertise this.

That's pretty much it!

See you on the next one ;)
