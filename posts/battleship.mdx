# Phoenix

What is Phoenix?

Phoenix is a framework that uses the MVC pattern to create applications. There are Models(using ecto, etc.), Controllers and Views(that use the HEEx templating language).

With phoenix comes a lot of pretty good stuff OOTB such as Phoenix LiveDashboard, Presence, PubSub, LiveView, Ecto integration, Mix Tasks for code generation, etc.

One such component is LiveView.
