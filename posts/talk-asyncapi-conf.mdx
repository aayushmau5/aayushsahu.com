Recently I gave a talk at [AsyncAPI Conference](https://conference.asyncapi.com/) about my Google Summer of Code(aka GSoC) project, [AsycAPI Diff](https://github.com/asyncapi/diff/). Being my first talk ever at this scale of audience & even though the talks were recorded, I was actually pretty nervous about giving the talk.

Therefore, I wrote this blog to share my experience & my learnings when giving this talk.

Just a month before the AsyncAPI conference, [Lukasz]()(one of AsyncAPI's maintainer) reached out to me and other GSoC students asking us to give a talk on the work we did during the GSoC period.

I was thrilled but at the same time, nervous to give the talk. There was a deadline to submit the talk by 5th of November.

But I kept procrastinating to record the talk, reason being I was a lot nervous than I thought I would be. But anyway, I managed to record the talk just a day before the deadline. Though in the end, I was not satisfied with the recording, I knew I could do better, but because of the deadline, I went to "good enough".

In the process, I learned how to use OBS studio, optimize it for recording, as well as setting the background and cropping the output of my webcam.

I also learned about KDENLive, and how to edit videos. KDENLive was actually a lot easier to learn, and just 5 minutes after opening the application, I knew how to crop videos. So, major props to KDENLive devs for keeping it simple, and intuitive.

Learning: Do the task as early as you can.

My spoken english was a bit shit, I got to know that I have to improve my communication skills and spoken english. And I have to work on my accent as well.
