The usual way of installing [Sonic-Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) on Linux is building it using [this guide](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/stable/BUILD-LINUX.md).

I'm using Pop-OS, and I had to do some additional things to make it work. Let's see what are those.

First, the guide says to install the following packages:

<BasicCard>

build-essential git libssl-dev ruby-dev elixir erlang-dev erlang-xmerl qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev supercollider-server sc3-plugins-server alsa-utils jackd2 libjack-jackd2-dev libjack-jackd2-0 libasound2-dev pulseaudio-module-jack cmake ninja-build

</BasicCard>

But in my case, there was a conflict with `pulseaudio` with the exisiting pulseaudio application installed in Pop-OS. So, I had to remove `pulseaudio-module-jack` from the installation list.

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git libssl-dev ruby-dev elixir erlang-dev erlang-xmerl qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev supercollider-server sc3-plugins-server alsa-utils jackd2 libjack-jackd2-dev libjack-jackd2-0 libasound2-dev cmake ninja-build
```

Now, I started building sonic-pi, but was met with another error.

<BasicCard>

cannot find -ldbus-1

</BasicCard>

To fix this, I had to install `libdbus-glib-1-dev`.

```
sudo apt install libdbus-glib-1-dev
```

Now, it worked. Everything built successfully, and now I'm ready to make some sick beats ;)
