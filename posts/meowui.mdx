Introducing MeowUI, a TUI written in Rust using the Ratatui library. I have always wanted to work on a TUI project because most of my time is spent in the terminal :)

Initially, my plan with the TUI project was to make it using elixir and cluster the locally running elixir node with the [one running on fly.io](https://phoenix.aayushsahu.com/) but elixir has not much good support for making TUIs(raw mode for terminal landed on erlang/OTP 28) so I kind of abandoned the plan of making a TUI in elixir but since then two things happened:

1. I learned rust. Ever since I got the hang of rust, I wanted to work on a project to solidify my learnings.
2. I found out that the LiveView Native team have worked on a rust library for [Phoenix Channels client](https://github.com/liveview-native/phoenix-channels-client) which I can use to establish a channel connection to my phoenix backend.

So I set out to work on a TUI project and here it is: https://github.com/aayushmau5/meowui

Honestly, I had a lot of fun writing Rust. The type system is really. Compile time were fairly good. Practised a ton on borrow checker and ownership models. Traits are a nice abstraction. (These are my opinions at the time of writing this blog. It is subject to change in the future, who knows?)

## Usecase

The TUI project is a 100% personal project that I made for me. It is a project manager, a pastebin manager(pastebin clone that I made in phoenix), notes manager, etc.

On running, it connects to my phoenix backend using phoenix channels and sends/receives events + data.

## ToDos

Still, a lot of work is to be done. I have established a common pattern for the TUI but some things are pending:

- Pastebin support: reading, creating, updating, deleting -> Done
- Adding sqlite for offline support
- Syncing between local sqlite and remote phoenix postgres(this will be fun)
- Adding support for notes
- Project management is still WIP

Quite some work is left, but I'm excited to work on them.

That's it about MeowUI. See you later ðŸ‘‹

(I might/might not be working on a new project until then)
