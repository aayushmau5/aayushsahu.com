Using [ExAWS](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws) library to interact with AWS S3. The setup steps is given in the library's documentation.

It returns a map with all the objects listed. Used [Jason](https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason) to convert the returned map to JSON data. You can also loop through the contents using `Enum.map`.

```elixir
defmodule ElixirS3 do
  def list_objects() do
    {:ok, data} = ExAws.S3.list_objects("links-data") |> ExAws.request()

    jsonData =
      data.body.contents
      |> Enum.map(fn x -> %{key: x.key} end) # Just getting the `key` from objects
      |> Jason.encode!()

    File.write!("./data.json", jsonData)
  end
end

ElixirS3.list_objects()
```

There's also [aws-elixir](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-elixir) library to work with AWS.
