title: "Setting response header for JSON responses in Flask"
description: "In a flask API"

Working with flask, I had to add custom headers when we send a response to the client. I used Flask's `make_response` function to create a `Response` object explicitly(otherwise `Response` object is created automatically by flask).

I used `jsonify` to convert python's dictionary to JSON data.

First argument to `make_response` will be the JSON data, and second will be the HTTP response code.

I added headers by modifying the `headers` data of the response object, but I think you can also add headers directly in `make_response` call.

Here's the code:

```python
from flask import make_response, jsonify

# ..... other stuff

@app.route('/')
def home_route():
	response = make_response(jsonify({'hello': 'world'}), 200)
	response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*' # <- adding header
	return response
```
